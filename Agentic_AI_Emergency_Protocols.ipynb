For **serious incidents, injuries, and fatalities**, additional reporting to the government department responsible for health and safety is mandatory, triggering investigation requirements. The text emphasizes verifying specific legislative details with the appropriate agencies.\n",

            "For **serious incidents or workplace fatalities**, strict protocols are detailed: the immediate area must not be disturbed (with exceptions for first aid, preventing further harm, or protecting property) until authorities grant permission. The employer must promptly contact the 24-hour line of the government agency, and for fatalities, emergency services including the police. Investigations will follow, with employers required to assist and not penalize witnesses.\n",

            "Ontario has commenced construction on Highway 413, a significant new 52-kilometre 400-series highway and transit corridor. The project's primary goals are to alleviate severe traffic congestion in the Greater Golden Horseshoe, save drivers up to 30 minutes per trip, stimulate economic growth, and create thousands of jobs.\n",
            "\n",
            "The initial phase of construction involves building new bridges and widening existing ones between Renforth Drive and Highway 427 in Toronto. Once completed, Highway 413 will connect Highway 400 in Vaughan to Highway 401 in Halton Region, featuring 4-6 lanes, a dedicated multi-use path, and space for future transit.\n",
            "\n",
            "The government justifies the project by highlighting the region's rapid population growth (projected to increase by over two million in the next decade) and the anticipated doubling of truck traffic on Highway 401 by 2051. Premier Doug Ford and Minister of Transportation Prabmeet Sarkaria both emphasized the highway's importance as critical infrastructure for faster commutes, economic support, and connecting communities. The release also notes that advanced design work and rigorous environmental assessments are underway, with commitments to working closely with Indigenous communities and stakeholders.\n",
