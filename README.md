## Autonomous Health Monitoring Emergency Response

## Objective:

This application uses Bluetooth technology to connect the worker’s smartphone to the supervisor’s laptop, enabling real-time health monitoring via multimodal data. PySyft ensures encrypted biometric authentication with high accuracy and privacy protection. A machine learning model tracks fatalities and injury levels, visualized through a Matplotlib dashboard. When thresholds are breached, agentic AI triggers emergency protocols, recommends actions, and automatically initiates a 911 response with location and incident details. Target KPIs include 95% detection precision, 40% faster emergency response, and zero biometric data leakage.
